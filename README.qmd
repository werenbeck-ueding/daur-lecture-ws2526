This repository serves as a note repository for the course "Data Analysis Using R" held in winter semester 2025/26. In the `lecture` folder, you will find the scripts created during the lectures. The rest of the repository serves as an example repository for orientation in the group projects.

The code in this repository replicates the findings of @f20 using data from @f20data to briefly showcase how such a data analysis project can be structured. Please note that the structure outlined here serves as orientation only. There are several equally good ways of structuring your data analysis project. You can find the data used throughout the project in the `data` folder. The corresponding R scripts are stored under `scripts`. Folders `figures` and `tables` contain -- not surprisingly -- figures and tables created in the analysis. A presentation on the results created via [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) can be found under `presentation`.

## Key Findings

In "Fenced Out: The Impact of Border Construction on U.S.-Mexico Migration", @f20 explores how the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border fence following the Fence Secure Act from 2006 affected the migration decision of potential Mexican migrants. Using spatio-temporal variations in fence construction as an exogenous shock, @f20 applies a difference-in-differences approach to assess changes in migration likelihood. Data on fence construction was obtained through U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other government records. Data on the migration decision of Mexicans was obtained through Mexican household surveys. This repository uses a 50% random draw from @f20data to replicate the results. My findings indicate a significant reduction (37.4%) in migration likelihood due to the fence construction, though pre-treatment trends suggest potential overstatement of effects (see @fig-event-logit). The findings highlight the effectiveness of border enforcement policies but emphasize methodological limitations and deviations from the original study.
